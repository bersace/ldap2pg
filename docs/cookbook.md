<h1>Cookbook</h1>

Here in this cookbook, you'll find some recipes for various use case of
ldap2pg.

If you struggle to find a way to setup ldap2pg for your needs, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/issues/new) so that we can update
*Cookbook* with new recipes! Your contribution is welcome!


## Configure `pg_hba.conf` with LDAP

ldap2pg does **NOT** configure PostgreSQL for you. You should carefully read
[PostgreSQL LDAP documentation] for this point. Having PostgreSQL properly
configured **before** writing `ldap2pg.yaml` is a good start. Here is the steps
to setup PostgreSQL with LDAP in the best order:

- Write the LDAP search and test it with `ldapsearch(1)`. This way, you can
  also check how you connect to your LDAP directory.
- In PostgreSQL cluster, **manually** create a single role having its password
  in LDAP directory.
- Edit `pg_hba.conf` following [PostgreSQL LDAP documentation] until you can
  effectively login with the single role and the password from LDAP.

[PostgreSQL LDAP documentation]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-methods.html#auth-ldap

Once you have LDAP authentication configured in PostgreSQL cluster, you can
move to automate role creation from the LDAP directory using ldap2pg:

- Write a simple `ldap2pg.yaml` with only one LDAP search just to setup ldap2pg
  connection parameters for PostgreSQL and LDAP connection. ldap2pg always run
  in dry mode by default, so you can safely loop ldap2pg execution until you
  get it right.
- Then, complete `ldap2pg.yaml` to fit your needs following [ldap2pg
  documentation](cli.md). Run ldap2pg for real and check that ldap2pg maintain
  your single test role, and that you can still connect to the cluster with it.
- Finally, you must decide when and how you want to trigger synchronization: a
  regular cron tab ? An ansible task ? Manually ? Other ? Ensure ldap2pg
  execution is frequent, on purpose and notified.


## Configure Postgres Connection

The simplest case is to save the connection settings in `ldap2pg.yaml`, section
`postgres`:

``` yaml
postgres:
  dsn: postgres://user:password@host:port/
```

ldap2pg checks for file mode and refuse to read password in world readable
files. Ensure it is not world readable by setting a proper file mode:

``` console
$ chmod 0600 ldap2pg.yml
```

ldap2pg will warn about *Empty synchronization map* and ends with *Comparison
complete*. ldap2pg suggests to drop everything. Go on and write the
synchronization map to tell ldap2pg the required roles for the cluster.


## Search LDAP Directory

The first step is to search your LDAP server with ldapsearch(1), the CLI tool
from OpenLDAP. Like this:

``` console
$ ldapsearch -H ldaps://ldap.ldap2pg.docker -U testsasl -W -b dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker
Enter LDAP Password:
SASL/DIGEST-MD5 authentication started
SASL username: testsasl
SASL SSF: 128
SASL data security layer installed.
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
...
# search result
search: 4
result: 0 Success

# numResponses: 16
# numEntries: 15
$
```

Now save the settings in `ldaprc`:

``` yaml
LDAPURI ldaps://ldap.ldap2pg.docker
LDAPUSER testsasl
```

And in environment: `LDAPPASSWORD=secret`

Next, update your ldapsearch(1) to properly match role entries in LDAP server:

``` console
$ ldapsearch -H ldaps://ldap.ldap2pg.docker -U testsasl -W -b cn=dba,ou=groups,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker '' member
...
# dba, groups, ldap.ldap2pg.docker
dn: cn=dba,ou=groups,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker
member: cn=Alan,ou=people,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker
member: cn=albert,ou=people,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker
member: cn=ALICE,ou=people,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker

# search result
search: 4
result: 0 Success

...
$
```

Now translate the query in `ldap2pg.yaml` and associate a role mapping to
produce roles from each values of each entries returned by the LDAP search:

``` yaml
- ldapsearch:
    base: cn=dba,ou=groups,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker
  role:
    name: '{member.cn}'
    options: LOGIN SUPERUSER
```

Test it:

``` console
$ ldap2pg
...
Querying LDAP cn=dba,ou=groups,dc=ldap,dc=ldap2pg,dc=docker...
Would create alan.
Would create albert.
Would update options of alice.
...
Comparison complete.
$
```

Read further on how to control role creation from LDAP entry in
[Configuration](config.md). Once you're satisfied with the comparison output, go
real with `--real`.


## Using LDAP High-Availability

ldap2pg supports LDAP HA out of the box just like any openldap client. Use a
space separated list of URI to tells all servers.

``` console
$ LDAPURI="ldaps://ldap1 ldaps://ldap2" ldap2pg
```

See [ldap.conf(5)] for further details.

## Running as non-superuser

Since Postgres provide a `CREATEROLE` role option, you can manage roles without
superuser privileges. Security-wise, it's a good idea to manage roles without
super privileges.

ldap2pg supports this case. However, you must be careful about the limitations.
Let's call the non-super role creating other roles `creator`.

- You can't manage some roles options like `SUPERUSER`, `BYPASSRLS` and
  `REPLICATION`. Thus you wont be able to detect spurious superusers.
- Ensure `creator` can revoke all grants of managed users.
- `creator` should own database and other objects if you want `creator` to grant
  privileges on this. This include `public` schema.
- Granting `CREATE` on schema requires to grant write access to `pg_catalog`.
  That's tricky to give such privileges to `creator`.


## Revoking privileges

There is no explicit revoke in ldap2pg. ldap2pg inspects SQL grants,
ldap2pg.yml tells what privileges should be granted. Every unexpected grant is
revoked. This is called implicit revoke.

ldap2pg don't require any YAML `grant` to trigger inspection of Postgres for SQL
`GRANT`, and thus revoke. You just declare a privilege with an `inspect` query.
Of course, you'll need a `revoke` query too.

The following YAML is enough to revoke `CONNECT ON DATABASE` from `public` role:

``` yaml
privileges:
  mypriv:
    type: datacl
    inspect: |
      SELECT NULL, 'public';
    revoke: |
      REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {database} FROM {role};
```

The bug here, is that inspect does not truly inspect Postgres and always
returns the same result. ldap2pg will always execute the revoke query, thinking
`mypriv` is granted to `public`, whatever the actual state of the cluster. It's
up to you to dig in `pg_catalog.pg_database.datacl` to find SQL GRANT.


## Inherit Unmanaged Role

You may want to grand a local role, not managed by ldap2pg, to managed users.
This is tricky because ldap2pg can't manage members of a role without managing its own privileges and other options.
The solution is to isolate managed membership in a preexisting sub-role.

Say you have a `local_readers` roles with custom privileges and custom members.
You want ldap2pg to add member of this role from directory.
Prior to running ldap2pg, create a `local_readers_managed_members` role, member of `local_readers`:

``` sql
=# CREATE ROLE local_readers;
=# CREATE ROLE local_readers_managed_members;
=# GRANT local_readers TO local_readers_managed_members;
```

Now, in `ldap2pg.yml`, declare `local_readers_managed_members` and add members:

``` yaml
- role: local_readers_managed_members
- role:
    name: myuser
    parent: local_readers_managed_members
```

Ensure that `local_readers` is not returned by `managed_roles_query` to prevent any modifications by ldap2pg.
Now run ldap2pg as usual.
You'll see the message **add missing local_readers_managed_members members**.
That's it, ldap2pg will never touch `local_readers` privileges or direct members, but managed roles can inherit from it.


## Removing All Roles

If ever you want to clean all roles in a PostgreSQL cluster, ldap2pg could be
helpful. You must explicitly define an empty `rules`.

``` console
$ echo 'rules: []' | ldap2pg --config - --real
...
Empty synchronization map. All roles will be dropped!
...
```

In this example, default blacklist applies. ldap2pg never drop its connect
role.


## ldap2pg as Docker container

Already familiar with Docker and willing to save the setup time? You're at the
right place.

To run the container simply use the command:
``` console
$ docker run --rm dalibo/ldap2pg --help
```

The Docker image of ldap2pg use the same configuration options as explained in
the [cli](cli.md) and [ldap2pg.yml](config.md) sections. You can mount the
ldap2pg.yml configuration file.

``` console
$ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/ldap2pg.yml:/workspace/ldap2pg.yml dalibo/ldap2pg
```

You can also export some environmnent variables with the **-e** option:

``` console
$ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/ldap2pg.yml:/workspace/ldap2pg.yml -e PGDSN=postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/ -e LDAPURI=ldaps://localhost -e LDAPBINDDN=cn=you,dc=entreprise,dc=fr -e LDAPPASSWORD=pasglop dalibo/ldap2pg
```

Make sure your container can resolve the hostname your pointing to. If you use
some internal name resolution be sure to add the **--dns=** option to your
command pointing to your internal DNS server. More
